# Udacity Pizza App

This is an example from Udacity's [Javascript Design Patterns course](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-design-patterns--ud989) for how to use MV* frameworks.

This app demonstrates basics of how to organize javascript application code by separating concerns.

The application code is separated into three components i.e.
1. Model: This holds code that helps you store and access the data for your application
2. View: This holds user interface code
3. Controller/Presenter/ViewModel: This links the model with the view and manages user interactions
